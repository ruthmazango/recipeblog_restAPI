## Recipe Blog REST Project Description

This project was imported from an existing recipe blog application that I own. The main objective behind this endeavor was to create two distinct projects. The first one serves as a showcase, utilizing Thymeleaf to render and present the recipes in a visually appealing manner. The second project, on the other hand, focuses on providing a RESTful API to expose the recipe data.

### RESTful API Project

This second project exposes the recipe data through a RESTful API, providing a straightforward way for developers and other applications to access and utilize the recipe information programmatically. This API can be easily integrated into various applications, such as mobile apps, front-end frameworks, or any other platforms that can consume RESTful services.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating these two projects is to illustrate different methods of interacting with the recipe blog data. By having a Thymeleaf-powered showcase and a RESTful API, this project showcases the versatility and potential uses of the underlying data.
